# Jekyll starter

This is my somewhat opinionated jekyll starter template. It has the following things configured:

- No styles, build your own
- [Github pages](https://github.com/github/pages-gem) ready
- Custom navigation which hilights nested pages
- Blogging with pagination, commenting, etc.
- Google analytics & Facebook pixel ready
- [Jekyllplus](https://github.com/Wiredcraft/jekyllplus/) admin

### Howto run locally

```
gem install bundler
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve --profile
```
